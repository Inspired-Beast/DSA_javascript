Backtracking  - Backtracking is a trial-and-error based approach to solving computational problems. It involves building up a sequence of choices and, when a dead end (or unfeasible solution) is encountered, the algorithm backtracks to a previous decision point and tries a different path. This continues until a viable solution is found or all paths are exhausted.
